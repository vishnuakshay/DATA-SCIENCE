    "## Engineering Rare Labels / Rare Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Rare values are labels/ categories within a categorical variable that are only present for a small percentage of the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no rule of thumb to determine how small is a small percentage, but typically, any value below 5% may cause over-fitting in trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rare labels may exist in variables that have intrinsically a huge number of labels, or they can be present in variables with few labels (e.g., 2-10). There is no rule of thumb to determine how many different labels is big (and therefore represent high cardinality) and it will depend as well on how many observations there are in the dataset. In a dataset with 1,000 observations, 100 labels may seem a lot, whereas in a dataset with 100,000 observations it may not be so high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where rare labels are present in variables with only a few categories, the rare label may be adding some information. On the other hand, in variables with a high number of categories, likely there will be very many labels with a low frequency, which will quite likely add noise instead of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether rare labels should be processed before training a machine learning algorithm will depend on the dataset and problem at hand. Ideally, if there are not too many variables, you could try and explore the variables and their categories one at a time, and determine whether the rare labels add noise or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the dataset has very many categorical variables, and exploring one at a time is not an option you may choose to sacrifice the ideal / optimal performance for a higher delivery speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering rare labels\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of accounting for rare labels. Some of them handle rare labels at the same time of converting labels into numbers. I will explain those in the section \"Engineer labels of categorical variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the course, I will expand on how to handle rare labels by re-categorising the observation that show rare labels for a certain variable. These observations can be re-categorised by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replacing the rare label by most frequent label\n",
    "- Grouping the observations that show rare labels into a unique category (with a new label like 'Rare', or 'Other')\n",
    "\n",
    "In this and the coming lectures I will explain when it is convenient to use one or the other way of replacing rare values, and evaluate the consequences of replacing rare labels in variables with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One predominant category\n",
    "- A small number of categories\n",
    "- High cardinality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that grouping infrequent labels or categories under a new category called 'Rare' or 'Other' is the most common practice in machine learning for businesses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this lecture I will demonstrate how to work with rare labels in variables with one predominant category using the House Sale dataset from Kaggle."

    "These types of variables often are not useful for our predictions, and we should remove them from the set of features that we are going to use to build machine learning models. There are of course exceptions, for example in those cases in which the target is unbalanced, and therefore, the presence of the rare label is indeed informative. The rare label can also be informative in scenarios where the target is not unbalanced.\n",
