It is a megaproject with an estimated cost of over $500 billion, and plans include multiple regions, including a floating industrial complex, global trade hub, tourist resorts, and a linear city—all powered exclusively by renewable energy sources. The name \"Neom\" is a portmanteau of the Ancient Greek prefix νέο Neo- meaning \"new\" and the first letter of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's name and the first letter of the Arabic word for \"future\" (Arabic: مستقبل, romanized: Mustaqbal, Hejazi pronunciation: [mʊsˈtaɡbal]). It is intended to be a data-driven city, with data collected from the smartphones of the residents, their homes, facial recognition cameras and multiple other sensors, to help developers feed the collected information to the city for further predicting and customizing every user's needs. However, the project has been met with criticism due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record and use of espionage and surveillance technology for spying on its citizens, as well as a sponsorship with the League of Legends European Championship which gathered significant backlash</b>"
